# Steam Community Market Manager (SCMM)
SCMM is a fan-created project dedicated to collecting and analyzing data from the Steam Community Market and third-party marketplaces. Our goal is to document the history of the Steam market (and game item stores), detect market trends and patterns, and provide useful quality of life features not found in the official Steam Community Market app/website. Currently only a small subset of Steam apps are supported by SCMM, primarily [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/).

| | Website | Status |
|----|----|----|
|**Rust**|https://rust.scmm.app/store|✅ Fully supported.|
|**Unturned**|https://unturned.scmm.app/items|⚠ Work in progress. Basic historical data is available, but all data update jobs are disabled.|
|**CSGO**|https://csgo.scmm.app/items|⚠ Work in progress. Basic historical data is available, but all data update jobs are disabled.|

# Project architecture
SCMM started as a personal project to gain practical and hands-on experience using [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). Because of this, a lot of decisions within the project may seem strange, hacky, or overengineered. Sometimes things were done they way they are just as an excuse to try out a specific technology or feature and not because it was the most sensible or pragmatic option.
